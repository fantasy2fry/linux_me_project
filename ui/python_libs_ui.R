- **Norbert, Kuba, and Mateusz** extensively use Python across various aspects of their work, including:
  - Algebra
  - Data scraping from the internet
  - Creating plots and charts
  - Working with dataframes
  - Algorithm development
  - Graph visualization

- They encountered Python in courses such as:
  - Data Visualization Techniques
  - Fundamentals of Programming and Data Processing
  - Structured Data Processing

- The trio has a strong affinity for Python, particularly enjoying its usage through Jupyter Notebooks and IDEs like *Data Spell* or *Visual Studio Code*. They express a keen interest in further developing their Python skills, with future plans to explore machine learning using Python's rich array of libraries.")
